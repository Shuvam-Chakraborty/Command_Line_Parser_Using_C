# Command_Line_Parser_Using_C
This is a Simple Lexical Analyzer which parses through the input(source code) and counts the number of token. Test_Sum.cpp is the input sourcce code which has 33 tokens and a few comments. The TokenGenerator.cpp will remove the comments and count the number of valid tokens. In the output screen it shows the lexemes and tokens with total token count.
